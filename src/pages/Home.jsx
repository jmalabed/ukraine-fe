      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To promote and empower medical professionalsâ€™ foundational knowledge in
        primary trauma care working in low resource and austere environment. The
        desired outcome of foundational primary trauma training is so that lives
        are saved, and disabilities are reduced.

      <p>
        During times of conflict, even the most developed nations can struggle

        accessible resources diminish, when qualified personnel are being
        stretched thin this is the training that can improved safety amongst
        medical personnel, improve knowledge base and confidence, and ultimately
        empower people to perform lifesaving interventions to reduce loss of
        life and disability.
