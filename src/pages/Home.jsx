              Our mission is to promote and empower medical professionalsâ€™
              foundational knowledge in primary trauma care working in low
              resource and austere environment. The desired outcome of
              foundational primary trauma training is so that lives are saved,
              and disabilities are reduced.

            <p>
              During times of conflict, even the most developed nations can
              struggle accessing proper care. When infrastructure is
              compromised, when readily accessible resources diminish, when
              qualified personnel are being stretched thin, this is the training
              that can improved safety amongst medical personnel, improve
              knowledge base and confidence, and ultimately empower people to
              perform lifesaving interventions to reduce loss of life and
              disability.
